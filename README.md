# Reactant — Reactive Pattern Design

This project is intented to be a small and ligthweight “reactive” library. I believe the “new” paradigm recently called “reactive programming” is amazing. It makes code beautiful, orginized and easy to read.

I also think is not fair to be force into a big/complex library, so I created this little fella for really small projects.

## Why are you losing your time?

Don't know. I want to see if I can implement something that feels like doing chemistry.

**Note**: This library is NOT yet production-ready.
